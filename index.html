                <!-- Write a paragraph or two about myself here -->
                <p>My name is Alyssa Tung. I am an Extra Duty Coordinator Team Lead, currently working in Freehold NJ. I graduated from Montclair State University with a Fine Arts degree. My dream job was to work for Disney as a 3D computer animator. It seemed like a great idea to work for Disney, "The Happiest Place on Earth." But in reality it was a bit deceiving.<br>I was born and raised in Taiwan. My family and I moved to America 12 years ago for the American Dream. My parents struggled with learning English and gave up a lot for me and my brother. I am grateful for their brave decision and will always look for ways to repay them. I hope I can succeed in life to proved that they made the right decision.</p>
